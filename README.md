### Project Overview


This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the HR data of Meriskill to understand factors contributing to employee attrition and develop strategies for employee retention which is essential for maintaining a productive and motivated workforce. 

### Data Sources 

HR Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “HR Analytics.csv" file, which contains detailed information about each Employee working in the company. 

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning 
- Power Bl - Data Transformation & Visualization

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks: 
- Deleting redundant columns.
- Renaming the columns.
- Dropping duplicates.
- Cleaning individual columns.
- Remove the NaN values from the dataset
- Check for some more Transformations

### Exploratory Data Analysis

I use data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends related to employee attrition. Look for factors that may contribute to attrition. Common factors may include low job satisfaction, Travel Distance, Marital Status, or poor work-life balance.

### Retention Strategy Development

I developed employee retention strategies based on the identiﬁed factors contributing to attrition. Strategies may include:
- Work-Life Balance: Promote work-life balance by offering ﬂexible work arrangements.
- Recognition and Rewards: Recognize and reward high-performing employees to boost morale and motivation. 
- Facilitating Transportation: Offer subsidized staff buses to support employees' transportation costs. 
- Employee Engagement: Implement initiatives such as mentorship programs or team-building activities to increase employee engagement. 
- Transparent Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication channels to address employee concerns and feedback.
