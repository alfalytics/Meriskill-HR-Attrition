🧹

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Dropping duplicates
- Cleaning individual columns
- Remove the NaN values from the dataset
- Check for some more Transformations

### Exploratory Data Analysis

I used data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends related to employee attrition. Look for factors that may contribute to attrition. Common factors may include low job satisfaction 👍 or 👎, Travel Distance 🚗, Marital Status 👫, or poor work-life balance ⚖️.

### Retention Strategy Development

I developed employee retention strategies based on the identiﬁed factors contributing to attrition. Strategies may include:
- Work-Life Balance: Promote work-life balance by offering ﬂexible work arrangements.
- Recognition and Rewards: Recognize and reward high-performing employees to boost morale and motivation. 
- Facilitating Transportation: Offer subsidized staff buses to support employees' transportation costs. 
- Employee Engagement: Implement initiatives such as mentorship programs or team-building activities to increase employee engagement. 
- Transparent Communication: Maintain open and transparent communication channels to address employee concerns and feedback.
